# Prompt-Engineering
Write a bedtime story about a bat who is afraid of dark for children aged 5 to 7.

## AIM:
To implement the simple substitution technique named Caesar cipher using C language.

## ALOGORITHM:

STEP-1: Read the plain text from the user.

STEP-2: Read the key value from the user.

STEP-3: If the key is positive then encrypt the text by adding the key with each character in the plain text.

STEP-4: Else subtract the key from the plain text.

STEP-5: Display the cipher text obtained above.

## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT :
 Thus the implementation of ceasar cipher had been executed successfully.
